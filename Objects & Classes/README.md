Exercise: Objects and Classes

1.	Advertisement Message
Write a program that generate random fake advertisement message to extol some product. The messages must consist of 4 parts: laudatoryphrase + event + author + city. Use the following predefined parts:
•	Phrases – {"Excellent product.", "Such a great product.", "I always use that product.", "Best product of its category.", "Exceptional product.", "I can’t live without this product."}
•	Events – {"Now I feel good.", "I have succeeded with this product.", "Makes miracles. I am happy of the results!", "I cannot believe but now I feel awesome.", "Try it yourself, I am very satisfied.", "I feel great!"}
•	Authors – {"Diana", "Petya", "Stella", "Elena", "Katya", "Iva", "Annie", "Eva"}
•	Cities – {"Burgas", "Sofia", "Plovdiv", "Varna", "Ruse"}
The format of the output message is: {phrase} {event} {author} – {city}.
As an input, you take the number of messages to be generated. Print each random message at a separate line.
Examples
Input	Output
3	Such a great product. Now I feel good. Elena – Ruse
Excelent product. Makes miracles. I am happy of the results! Katya – Varna
Best product of its category. That makes miracles. Eva - Sofia

2.	Articles
Create an article class with the following properties:
•	Title – a string
•	Content – a string
•	Author – a string
The class should have a constructor and the following methods:
•	Edit (new content) – change the old content with the new one
•	ChangeAuthor (new author) – change the author
•	Rename (new title) – change the title of the article
•	override ToString – print the article in the following format: "{title} - {content}: {autor}"
Write a program that reads an article in the following format "{title}, {content}, {author}". On the next line, you will get a number n. On the next n lines, you will get one of the following commands:"Edit: {new content}"; "ChangeAuthor: {new author}"; "Rename: {new title}". At the end, print the final article.
Example
Input	Output
some title, some content, some author
3
Edit: better content
ChangeAuthor:  better author
Rename: better title	better title - better content: better author

3.	Articles 2.0
Change the program, so you can store a list of articles. You will not need the methods any more (except the ToString method). On the first line, you will get a number n. On the next n lines, you will get some articles in the same format as the previous task ("{title}, {content}, {author}"). Finally, you will get one of the three inputs: "title", "content", "author". You need to order the articles alphabetically based on the command and print them sorted by the given criteria. 
Example
Input	Output
2
Science, planets, Bill
Article, content, Johnny
title	Article - content: Johnny
Science - planets: Bill
3
title1, C, author1
title2, B, author2
title3, A, author3
content	title3 - A: author3
title2- B: author2
title1- C: author1

4.	Students
Write a program that receives a n count of students and orders them by grade (in descending). Each student should have First name (string), Last name (string) and grade (floating-point number). 
Input
•	First line will be a number n
•	Next n lines you will get a student info in the format "{first name} {second name} {grade}"
Output
•	Print each student in the following format "{first name} {second name}: {grade}"
Example
Input	Output
4
Lakia Eason 3.90
Prince Messing 5.49
Akiko Segers 4.85
Rocco Erben 6.00	Rocco Erben: 6.00
Prince Messing: 5.49
Akiko Segers: 4.85
Lakia Eason: 3.90

5.	Teamwork projects
It's time for teamwork projects and you are responsible for making the teams. First you will receive an integer - the count of the teams you will have to register. You will be given a user and a team (separated with “-”).  The user is the creator of that team.
For every newly created team you should print a message: "Team {team Name} has been created by {user}!".
Next you will receive user with team (separated with "->") which means that the user wants to join that team. Upon receiving the command: “end of assignment”, you should print every team, ordered by the count of its members (descending) and then by name (ascending). For each team (disband teams as well), you have to print its members sorted by name (ascending). However, there are several rules:
•	If user tries to create a team more than once a message should be displayed: 
-	"Team {teamName} was already created!"
•	Creator of a team cannot create another team - message should be thrown: 
-	"{user} cannot create another team!"
•	If user tries to join currently non-existing team a message should be displayed: 
-	"Team {teamName} does not exist!"
•	Member of a team cannot join another team - message should be thrown:
-	"Member {user} cannot join team {team Name}!"
•	In the end (after teams' report) teams with zero members (with only a creator) should disband ordered by name in ascending other. 
•	 Every valid team should be printed ordered by name (ascending) in this format:
"{teamName}:
- {creator}
-- {member}…"
Examples
Input	Output	Comments
2
Didi-PowerPuffsCoders
Toni-Toni is the best
Petq->PowerPuffsCoders
Toni->Toni is the best
end of assignment	Team PowerPuffsCoders has been created by Didi!
Team Toni is the best has been created by Toni!
Member Toni cannot join team Toni is the best!
PowerPuffsCoders
- Didi
-- Petq
Teams to disband:
Toni is the best	Toni created a team in which he tried later to join. So message was shown. Since there is no one other who is trying to join his team the team have to disband.

Tatyana-CloneClub
Helena-CloneClub
Trifon-AiNaBira
Pesho->aiNaBira
Pesho->AiNaBira
Tatyana->Leda
PeshO->AiNaBira
Cossima->CloneClub
end of assignment	Team CloneClub has been created by Tatyana!
Team CloneClub was already created!
Team AiNaBira has been created by Trifon!
Team aiNaBira does not exist!
Team Leda does not exist!
AiNaBira
- Trifon
-- Pesho
-- PeshO
CloneClub
- Tatyana
-- Cossima
Teams to disband:	Note that when you join a team you should check first if it exists, then check if the user is already in a team:

Tatyana has created CloneClub, then she tries to join a non-existing team – so message for non-existing team is shown.

6.	VehicleCatalogue
You have to make a catalogue for vehicles. You will receive two types of vehicle – car or truck. 
Until you receive the command “End” you will receive lines of input in the format:
{typeOfVehicle} {model} {color} {horsepower}
After the “End” command, you will start receiving models of vehicles. Print for every received vehicle its data in the format:
Type: {typeOfVehicle}
Model: {modelOfVehicle}
Color: {colorOfVehicle}
Horsepower: {horsepowerOfVehicle}
When you receive the command “Close the Catalogue”, stop receiving input and print the averagehorsepower for the cars and for the trucks in the format:
{typeOfVehicles} have average horsepower of {averageHorsepower}.
The averagehorsepower is calculated by dividing the sum of horsepower for all vehicles of the type by the totalcount of vehicles from the sametype.
Format the answer to the 2nd decimal point.
Constraints
•	The type of vehicle will always be car or truck.
•	You will not receive the samemodeltwice.
•	The received horsepower will be integer in the interval [1…1000]
•	You will receive at most 50 vehicles.
•	Single whitespace will be used for separator.
Examples
Input	Output
truck Man red 200
truck Mercedes blue 300
car Ford green 120
car Ferrari red 550
car Lamborghini orange 570
End
Ferrari
Ford
Man
Close the Catalogue	Type: Car
Model: Ferrari
Color: red
Horsepower: 550
Type: Car
Model: Ford
Color: green
Horsepower: 120
Type: Truck

Cars have average horsepower of: 413.33.
Trucks have average horsepower of: 250.00.

7.	Order by Age
You will receive an unknown number of lines. On each line, you will receive array with 3 elements. The first element will be string and represents the name of the person. The second element will be a string and will represent the ID of the person. The last element will be an integer and represents the age of the person.
When you receive the command “End”, stop taking input and print all thepeople, ordered by age. 
Examples
Input	Output
Georgi 123456 20
Pesho 78911 15
Stefan 524244 10
End	Stefan with ID: 524244 is 10 years old.
Pesho with ID: 78911 is 15 years old.
Georgi with ID: 123456 is 20 years old.
